Version 5.10 (July 2004)

Known Issues
-------------------
The driver installer, haspdinst.exe, does not install drivers on Windows NT 4.0 
and Windows 95 platforms.

HASP HL drivers are not available for DOS applications. To run protected 
DOS applications you must install the corresponding HASP driver. 

Under Windows XP, a HASP HL key must have been previously connected to 
the computer to enable haspdinst.exe to display the correct HASP HL drivers 
version.

Under Windows 9x/ME, HL-Server won't detect Hardlock Server USB keys. You 
should install the required Hardlock drivers.

When running the HASP HL driver installer in a Terminal Server environment, 
the aksdrvsetup.log  file is generated in the current user’s directory. 

Older device driver installations sometimes overwrite the HASP HL drivers. You 
should run the haspdinst installer (haspdinst.exe -i) to fix the HASP HL 
installation. This scenario is only relevant for Windows XP/2003 platforms. 

The current version of the drivers does not support applications wrapped with 
HASP HL Envelope with overlay encryption enabled. Should you attempt to 
start these applications, your system will crash and display a blue screen. 

If you use USB hubs which do not comply with all specifications of the USB 
standard, your Aladdin USB keys might occasionally lose their enumeration.  If 
you plan to use USB keys on Microsoft platforms, refer to the Hardware 
Compatibility Lists at http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/hcl/default.mspx

Some USB controllers cause Microsoft platforms to hang or display a blue 
screen. This problem is not related to Aladdin drivers. 

There are known limitations with various PCMCIA card reader brands used 
on AMD64 platforms. Check for chipset compatibility in the hardware 
specifications provided by the manufacturer the of card reader. 

Due to a problem with the hardware of the PCI crypto programmer card, in 
some cases a Hardlock key will be recognized on the CPC address, however, 
encryption and read/write memory functions will fail. To avoid this problem,
you should explicitly set the address where to search for the Hardlock key.
